# data4good-slides
Slides of my presentation at [Data for Good Barcelona meetup](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/Data-For-Good-Barcelona/events/256711334/): Data Visualization and Topic Modelling to answer key questions in the grantmaking sector.

The presentation gives an overview of my project [Who has funded what themes throughout the years?](http://www.xavigimenez.net/360giving-grantmaking-themes), awarded with the 1st prize at the 360giving Data Visualization Challenge ["Digging the data"](https://challenge.threesixtygiving.org/).

The slides gives first context about the 360giving organization (mission and vision) and their aim to use Open Data in the grantmaking section, followed by an introduction about what Topic Modelling is and why its useful and last but no least, the critera and the creative process behind the Visualization (design decisions, type of viz, interaction, ...)
